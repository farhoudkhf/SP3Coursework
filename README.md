The coursework portfolio
The portfolio consists of:
1. weekly programming exercises of which you need to submit 70% of them,
2. an individual coursework assignment,
3. a "pair" coursework assignment, and
4. a "group" coursework assignment.

More emphasis will be given to the later coursework assignment and the exercises.
We aim to grade (and provide feedback) on the coursework assignments within 
two to three weeks of the due date for that submission; 
the "cutoff" date is two weeks after the due date.
General feedback will be posted to this website.
